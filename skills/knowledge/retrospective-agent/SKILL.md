# Retrospective Agent — Post-Track Learning

Extracts learnings from completed tracks and updates the knowledge base, making every future track smarter.

## When This Runs

**Automatically** — The orchestrator calls this agent AFTER a track reaches COMPLETE status.

## Inputs

1. **Track's plan.md** — All tasks, including fix cycles
2. **Track's metadata.json** — Fix cycle count, lead consultations, blockers
3. **Track's commits** — What was actually built
4. **Track's spec.md** — Original requirements (to measure alignment)

## Workflow

### 1. Analyze Track Execution

Review the track's execution data:

```markdown
## Track Analysis: [track-id]

### Execution Summary
- **Total Tasks**: 12
- **Fix Cycles**: 1
- **Lead Consultations**: 3
- **Duration**: Plan to Complete

### What Worked Well
- [Extracted from smooth tasks with no fix cycles]

### What Caused Problems
- [Extracted from fix cycles and blocked tasks]

### Patterns Discovered
- [New solutions that could be reused]

### Errors Encountered
- [New error patterns and their fixes]
```

### 2. Extract Patterns

Look for reusable solutions in the completed work:

**Pattern Candidates**:
- Solutions that required multiple iterations to get right
- Code structures that were repeated across tasks
- Approaches that prevented anticipated problems
- Integrations that worked particularly well

**Pattern Template**:
```markdown
### [Pattern Name]
**Category**: [UI | State | API | Auth | Integration | Testing | Performance]
**Discovered**: [track-id] on [date]
**Problem**: What problem does this solve?
**Solution**: How to implement it
**Code Example**: (key code snippet)
**Gotchas**: Watch out for...
```

### 3. Extract Error Patterns

Look for errors that were fixed during the track:

**Error Candidates**:
- Errors that appeared in fix cycles
- Errors that blocked progress
- Errors with non-obvious solutions
- Errors likely to recur in similar work

**Error Template**:
```json
{
  "id": "err-XXX",
  "pattern": "Regex pattern matching the error",
  "category": "typescript|react|nextjs|supabase|stripe|etc",
  "context": "When this error typically occurs",
  "problem": "What causes this error",
  "solution": "How to fix it",
  "code_fix": "Code snippet if applicable",
  "occurrences": 1,
  "last_seen": "2026-01-31",
  "discovered_in": "track-id"
}
```

### 4. Identify Skill Improvements

Check if the track revealed workflow issues:

**Questions to Ask**:
- Did any step take longer than expected? Why?
- Were there repeated back-and-forth fix cycles?
- Did evaluators miss issues that appeared later?
- Were lead consultations helpful or did they escalate unnecessarily?
- Did the plan have gaps the executor discovered?

**Improvement Candidates**:
- Evaluator checklist additions
- Planner prompt enhancements
- New lead authority grants
- Workflow step modifications

### 5. Update Knowledge Base

#### Update patterns.md

Append new patterns to the appropriate category section:

```markdown
## [Category] Patterns

### [New Pattern Name]
**Category**: [Category]
**Discovered**: [track-id] on [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Problem**: [Problem statement]
**Solution**: [Solution description]
**Code Example**:
```[language]
[code]
```
**Gotchas**: [Warnings]
```

#### Update errors.json

Add new error patterns:

```typescript
// Read current errors.json
const errors = JSON.parse(await readFile('conductor/knowledge/errors.json'));

// Add new error
errors.errors.push({
  id: `err-${String(errors.errors.length + 1).padStart(3, '0')}`,
  pattern: "New error pattern regex",
  category: "category",
  context: "When this occurs",
  problem: "What causes it",
  solution: "How to fix",
  code_fix: "Code if applicable",
  occurrences: 1,
  last_seen: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  discovered_in: trackId
});

// Write back
await writeFile('conductor/knowledge/errors.json', JSON.stringify(errors, null, 2));
```

### 6. Create Track Retrospective

Write a retrospective file for the track:

**Location**: `conductor/tracks/[track-id]/retrospective.md`

```markdown
# Retrospective: [Track ID]

**Completed**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Duration**: [X days/hours]
**Fix Cycles**: [N]

## Summary

[1-2 sentence summary of what the track accomplished]

## What Worked Well

- [Thing 1]
- [Thing 2]

## What Caused Problems

- [Problem 1]: [How it was resolved]
- [Problem 2]: [How it was resolved]

## Patterns Extracted

- **[Pattern Name]** → Added to patterns.md under [Category]

## Errors Logged

- **[Error Pattern]** → Added to errors.json as err-XXX

## Skill Improvements Proposed

- [ ] [Improvement 1] — [Which skill to update]
- [ ] [Improvement 2] — [Which skill to update]

## Recommendations for Similar Tracks

- [Advice for future tracks doing similar work]
```

## Output Format

The Retrospective Agent returns:

```json
{
  "track_id": "feature-name_20260131",
  "completed_at": "2026-01-31T15:00:00Z",

  "patterns_added": [
    {
      "name": "Pattern Name",
      "category": "Category",
      "added_to": "conductor/knowledge/patterns.md"
    }
  ],

  "errors_added": [
    {
      "id": "err-011",
      "pattern": "Error pattern",
      "added_to": "conductor/knowledge/errors.json"
    }
  ],

  "skill_improvements": [
    {
      "skill": "loop-executor",
      "improvement": "Add checkpoint after each task for better resumption",
      "priority": "medium"
    }
  ],

  "retrospective_file": "conductor/tracks/feature-name_20260131/retrospective.md"
}
```

## Integration with Orchestrator

The orchestrator triggers retrospective after completion:

```typescript
// In conductor-orchestrator, after track reaches COMPLETE
async function runRetrospective(trackId: string) {
  const result = await Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "Run track retrospective",
    prompt: `You are the retrospective-agent.

      Track: ${trackId}

      1. Read conductor/tracks/${trackId}/plan.md
      2. Read conductor/tracks/${trackId}/metadata.json
      3. Analyze what worked and what failed
      4. Extract patterns → Update conductor/knowledge/patterns.md
      5. Extract errors → Update conductor/knowledge/errors.json
      6. Write retrospective to conductor/tracks/${trackId}/retrospective.md

      Return summary of learnings added.`
  });

  console.log(`Retrospective complete. ${result.patterns_added.length} patterns, ${result.errors_added.length} errors added.`);
}
```

## Skip Conditions

Skip retrospective if:
- Track had 0 fix cycles AND 0 lead consultations (nothing notable to learn)
- Track was trivial (< 3 tasks)
- Track was documentation-only

## Learning Priorities

Prioritize extracting learnings about:

1. **High-value patterns** — Solutions that took multiple attempts to get right
2. **Recurring errors** — Errors similar to ones we've seen before
3. **Process friction** — Steps that caused unnecessary delay
4. **Lead decisions** — Whether lead consultations were helpful

## Continuous Improvement

Over time, the knowledge base grows:
- More patterns → Faster planning (reuse solutions)
- More errors → Faster fixing (known solutions)
- Skill improvements → Better workflows

The goal: **Every track makes the next track easier.**
