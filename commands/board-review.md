# /orchestrator-supaconductor:board-review — Quick Expert Assessment

Run a quick assessment from the 5-member Board of Directors. Each director provides their expert opinion in parallel, without the discussion phase.

## Usage

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:board-review [proposal or leave blank to review current track]
```

## Workflow

1. **Load Proposal** — From argument or current track's plan.md
2. **Parallel Assessment** — All 5 directors evaluate simultaneously
3. **Aggregate Results** — Combine verdicts into summary

## Directors

| Director | Domain |
|----------|--------|
| **CA** - Chief Architect | Technical design, scalability, patterns |
| **CPO** - Chief Product Officer | User value, market fit, scope |
| **CSO** - Chief Security Officer | Security, compliance, risk |
| **COO** - Chief Operations Officer | Feasibility, timeline, resources |
| **CXO** - Chief Experience Officer | UX/UI, accessibility, design |

// Dispatch all 5 directors in parallel
const assessments = await Promise.all([
  Task({
    subagent_type: "general-purpose",
    description: "CA board assessment",
