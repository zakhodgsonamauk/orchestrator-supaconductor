# /orchestrator-supaconductor:go — Goal-Driven Entry Point

**The single entry point to the entire Conductor system.**

Just state your goal. The system handles everything else.

## Usage

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go <your goal>
```

## Examples

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Add Stripe payment integration
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Fix the login bug where users get logged out
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Build a dashboard with analytics
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Refactor the API layer to use caching
```

## Your Task

You ARE the `/orchestrator-supaconductor:go` entry point. When invoked, follow this process:

### 1. Goal Analysis

Parse the user's goal from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- Identify the type (feature, bugfix, refactor, etc.)
- Estimate complexity
- Extract key requirements

If no arguments provided, check for an active track in `conductor/tracks.md` and resume it. If no active track exists, analyze the codebase and recent git history to infer the next logical task, then proceed autonomously.

### 2. Track Detection

Check `conductor/tracks.md` for matching existing tracks:
- If match found: Resume that track from its current state
- If no match: Create a new track

### 3. For New Tracks

1. Create track directory: `conductor/tracks/{goal-slug}_{date}/`
2. Generate `spec.md` from the goal
3. Generate `plan.md` with DAG
4. Create `metadata.json` with v3 schema **AND** set `superpower_enhanced: true` (new tracks use superpowers by default)

**Example metadata.json:**
```json
{
  "version": 3,
  "track_id": "goal-slug_20260213",
  "type": "feature",
  "status": "new",
  "superpower_enhanced": true,
  "loop_state": {
    "current_step": "NOT_STARTED",
    "step_status": "NOT_STARTED"
  }
}
```

### 4. Run the Evaluate-Loop

Invoke the conductor-orchestrator agent to run the full evaluate-loop:

```
Use the conductor-orchestrator agent to run the evaluate-loop for this track.
```

The orchestrator will:
- Detect current step from metadata
- Check `superpower_enhanced` flag to determine which agents to use:
  - **If true (new tracks):** Dispatch superpowers (orchestrator-supaconductor:writing-plans, orchestrator-supaconductor:executing-plans, orchestrator-supaconductor:systematic-debugging)
  - **If false/missing (legacy):** Dispatch legacy loop agents (loop-planner, loop-executor, loop-fixer)
- Monitor progress and handle failures
- Complete the track or escalate if blocked

## Decision Resolution

Behavior depends on `conductor/config.json` → `"mode"`:

### Mode: `"agentic"` (default)
Fully autonomous — NEVER stops to ask the user:
- **Goal is ambiguous** → Pick the most likely interpretation based on codebase context
- **Multiple interpretations** → Spawn a Plan subagent to analyze and choose the best one
- **Scope conflicts** → Merge into relevant existing track or create non-overlapping track
- **Board rejects the plan** → Re-plan incorporating board feedback automatically
- **Fix cycle exceeds limit** → Try alternative approaches, then mark track as needs-review
- **Blockers** → Log in metadata, skip blocked tasks, continue with unblocked work

### Mode: `"human-in-the-loop"`
Pauses at key decision points to ask the user:
- **Goal is ambiguous** → Present interpretations, ask user to pick
- **Multiple tracks match** → Present options, ask user which to resume
- **Scope conflicts** → Ask user how to proceed
- **Board rejects the plan** → Present board feedback, ask user for direction
- **Fix cycle exceeds 3** → Present recurring issues, ask user what to do
- **Blockers** → Report blocker, ask user for resolution

**To switch modes**: Edit `conductor/config.json` → `"mode": "agentic"` or `"human-in-the-loop"`

## Resume Existing Work

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go                    # Continues the active track
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go continue           # Same as above
```

## What Happens End-to-End

```
User: /orchestrator-supaconductor:go Add a hello world API

1. Goal Analysis → type: feature, complexity: small
2. Track Detection → no existing match
3. Create Track → conductor/tracks/add-hello-world-api_20260216/
   - spec.md generated
   - plan.md generated with DAG
   - metadata.json created
4. Evaluate-Loop begins:
   PLAN → EVALUATE PLAN → EXECUTE → EVALUATE EXECUTION
                                          │
                                     PASS → COMPLETE
                                     FAIL → FIX → re-EVALUATE (loop)
5. Track marked complete
6. Report delivered to user
```
