## What's New in v3.7.0

- **Board of Directors fast-path** — Routine tracks now use a single Opus call (all 5 lenses in one pass) at ~1/10th the cost of the full multi-agent deliberation. Full board is reserved for high-stakes decisions: production deploys, security architecture, breaking API changes, data-loss migrations.
- **Plan revision guard** — Prevents infinite planning loops. Tracks the number of times a plan is rejected and calls it done (with warnings) after 3 revisions.
- **Execution state reconciliation** — On session resume, `plan.md` checkboxes are now treated as the source of truth. Prevents already-completed tasks from being re-executed after a crash.
- **Atomic file locks** — Parallel workers can no longer accidentally acquire the same file lock simultaneously. Uses `fcntl` OS-level locking on a dedicated mutex file.
- **Bounded knowledge injection** — The knowledge brief injected before planning is capped at 500 tokens (top-3 most relevant patterns and errors). Prevents context growth as your project's knowledge base accumulates.

---

## What Does This Do?

You tell Claude Code what you want. SupaConductor figures out how to build it — step by step, with quality checks at every stage.

**Without SupaConductor**, you prompt Claude Code and hope for the best. You manually review, re-prompt, and fix what it misses.

**With SupaConductor**, you type one command:

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Add user authentication with Google OAuth
```

And it automatically:
1. Writes a detailed specification
2. Creates an implementation plan with task dependencies
3. Executes each task (in parallel when possible)
4. Checks the work with specialized evaluators
5. Fixes any issues it finds
6. Marks the work complete when everything passes

No babysitting. No re-prompting. Just describe what you want and walk away.

---

## What's Inside

| Component | Count | What It Does |
|-----------|------:|-------------|
| **Commands** | 36 | Slash commands you type to control everything |
| **Skills** | 39 | Specialized knowledge modules that activate when needed |
| **Agents** | 15 | Autonomous workers that handle planning, coding, and evaluation |
| **Evaluators** | 4 | Quality checkers for UI/UX, code quality, integrations, and business logic |
| **Board of Directors** | 5 | Virtual executives who deliberate on major decisions |
| **Lead Engineers** | 4 | Architecture, Product, Tech, and QA specialists |

Bundles [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) v4.3.0 (MIT) — everything works out of the box with zero setup.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Marketplace (recommended)

Open Claude Code and run:

```
/install zakhodgsonamauk/orchestrator-supaconductor
```

### Option 2: Clone from GitHub

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zakhodgsonamauk/orchestrator-supaconductor.git ~/.claude/plugins/orchestrator-supaconductor
```

### Option 3: Download manually

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/zakhodgsonamauk/orchestrator-supaconductor/releases) and extract it to `~/.claude/plugins/orchestrator-supaconductor/`.

### Verify it works

Start a new Claude Code session and type `/orchestrator-supaconductor:`. You should see a list of commands appear. If you see `/orchestrator-supaconductor:go`, you're all set.

---

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up your project

Open Claude Code in your project folder and run:

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:setup
```

This walks you through an interactive setup that:
- Analyzes your existing codebase (or starts fresh for new projects)
- Helps define your product vision and tech stack
- Creates a `conductor/` folder in your project to track all work
- Generates an initial development sprint with ready-to-execute tracks

You only need to do this once per project.

### Step 2: Build something

Tell it what you want in plain English:

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Add Stripe payment integration with webhooks
```

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Fix the login bug where users get logged out after refresh
```

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Build a dashboard with real-time analytics charts
```

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go Refactor the database layer to use connection pooling
```

That's it. SupaConductor takes over from here — planning, coding, testing, and evaluating the work automatically.

### Step 3: Check on progress

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:status
```

Shows all your active tracks, what step each one is on, and what's completed.

### Step 4: Resume interrupted work

If a session ends before a track completes, just run:

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:go
```

It picks up exactly where it left off.

---

## How It Works

Every piece of work follows a structured cycle called the **Evaluate-Loop**:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/evaluate-loop.png" alt="Evaluate-Loop: Plan, Evaluate Plan, Execute, Evaluate Execution, Fix or Complete" width="700"/>
</p>

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Plan** | Breaks your goal into tasks with a dependency graph |
| **Evaluate Plan** | Checks for scope issues, overlap with other work, and feasibility |
| **Execute** | Writes code, runs tests, tracks progress — parallel when possible |
| **Evaluate Execution** | Specialized checkers review UI/UX, code quality, integrations, and business logic |
| **Fix** | Addresses any failures, then loops back to evaluation (up to 5 fix cycles; up to 3 plan revisions) |
| **Complete** | All checks pass — track is marked done |

The loop runs fully automated. It stops when the work passes all quality checks or when it needs your input.

### Parallel Execution

When tasks don't depend on each other, they run simultaneously:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/parallel-execution.png" alt="Parallel execution showing independent tasks running at the same time" width="700"/>
</p>

This means a feature with 6 tasks might only take as long as 3, because independent tasks run in parallel.

### Two Modes

SupaConductor can work in two ways:

| Mode | Behavior | Best For |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Agentic** (default) | Fully autonomous — makes all decisions itself | Experienced users who trust the system |
| **Human-in-the-loop** | Pauses at key decision points to ask you | Learning the system, critical work, or when you want more control |

Switch modes by editing `conductor/config.json` in your project:

```json
{ "mode": "agentic" }
```
```json
{ "mode": "human-in-the-loop" }
```

---

## Model Selection

Models are **configurable**, not hardcoded. Each command maps to a role — **planning**
or **execution** — and each role has a default model. Set them in `conductor/config.json`:

```json
{
  "models": {
    "planning": "opus",
    "execution": "sonnet",
    "overrides": {
      "board-meeting": "opus",
      "new-track": "inherit"
    }
  }
}
```

- **`planning` / `execution`** — default model per role.
- **`overrides`** — pin an individual command to any model or `inherit`. One entry per line.
- **Tokens** — aliases `opus` `sonnet` `haiku` `fable`, exact ids
  (`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, `claude-fable-5`),
  or `inherit` (use the current session model).
- **Legacy** — top-level `planning_model` / `execution_model` are still honored.

### `/use-models` — per-session override

```
/use-models fable+sonnet   # planning=fable, execution=sonnet for this session
/use-models opus           # both roles = opus
/use-models show           # print the resolved model for every command
/use-models reset          # clear the session overlay
```

This writes `conductor/.session-models.json` (not committed). It sets the two role
models; per-command `overrides` in `config.json` still win.

**Precedence:** command pin > session overlay > role default > `inherit`.

### Interactive vs orchestrated (important)

- **Orchestrated path** (the autonomous Evaluate-Loop, which spawns child
  `claude --print` processes) fully honors config, overrides, and `/use-models` via
  `scripts/resolve-model.sh`.
- **Interactive path** (you typing a command in your own session) inherits your current
  session model — frontmatter is `inherit`, so the command runs on whatever model your
  session uses. Per-command overrides and the overlay cannot change that here, because a
  command's frontmatter is static. Running your session on Fable therefore runs
  interactive commands on Fable — no more forced Opus/Sonnet.

## Board of Directors

For major decisions — and automatically for high-stakes tracks like production deploys, security architecture changes, breaking API migrations, or data-loss operations — a virtual board deliberates with written rationale:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/board-of-directors.png" alt="Board of Directors: 5 executive perspectives deliberating on a decision" width="700"/>
</p>

| Director | Focus |
|----------|-------|
| **Chief Architect** | System design, scalability, technical debt |
| **Chief Product Officer** | User value, market fit, feature scope |
| **Chief Security Officer** | Vulnerabilities, compliance, data protection |
| **Chief Operations Officer** | Feasibility, timelines, deployment risks |
| **Chief Experience Officer** | UX/UI, accessibility, user journeys |

Each director independently assesses your question, then they discuss and vote with written rationale.

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:board-meeting Should we migrate from REST to GraphQL?
```

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:board-review Add real-time notifications via WebSocket
```

Use `board-meeting` for full deliberation (detailed, takes longer) or `board-review` for quick assessments.

### What gets created in your project

When you run `/orchestrator-supaconductor:setup`, it creates a `conductor/` folder:

```
your-project/
+-- conductor/
    |-- tracks.md                # Registry of all your work tracks
    |-- config.json              # Mode setting (agentic or human-in-the-loop)
    |-- workflow.md              # How the development process works
    |-- authority-matrix.md      # Who can make which decisions
    |-- decision-log.md          # Record of architectural decisions
    |-- product.md               # Product vision and requirements
    |-- tech-stack.md            # Technology choices and constraints
    |-- knowledge/
    |   |-- patterns.md          # Patterns learned from completed work
    |   +-- errors.json          # Fixes for recurring errors
    +-- tracks/
        +-- feature-name/
            |-- spec.md          # What needs to be built

            +-- metadata.json    # Current state and configuration
```

All of these are plain Markdown and JSON files. You can read, edit, or delete them anytime.

## FAQ

### Do I need to know how to code?

You need [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and running — that requires basic terminal knowledge. But once SupaConductor is set up, you describe what you want in plain English and it handles the implementation.

### How much does this cost in API credits?

SupaConductor uses the same Claude API as normal Claude Code — it just structures the work more carefully. Because it runs multiple agents (planning, execution, evaluation), it uses roughly **3-5x** the API calls compared to doing everything manually in one conversation.

SupaConductor optimizes costs automatically: it uses **Opus** (the most capable model) for planning and evaluation, and **Sonnet** (faster, cheaper) for execution tasks.

Ways to reduce cost:
- Use `/orchestrator-supaconductor:implement` if you write specs yourself
- Skip board meetings for small features (they're opt-in)
- Use human-in-the-loop mode to stay in control of scope

### How much of my context window does this use?

Skills use **progressive disclosure** — only ~100 tokens each for metadata. Full instructions load only when activated (typically under 5,000 tokens each). The 39 skills are not loaded all at once.

Agents run as **separate conversations** with their own context windows, so they don't fill up your main conversation.

| Component | Context Used | When |
|-----------|-------------|------|
| Orchestrator | ~4,000 tokens | Active during `/go` |
| Planner | ~3,000 tokens | During planning only |
| Evaluator | ~2,500 tokens each | Only the active evaluator loads |
| Board meeting | ~5,000 tokens | On-demand only |
| Idle | ~500 tokens | Between steps |

### Does this work with Cursor, Windsurf, or other AI tools?

No — SupaConductor is a Claude Code plugin that requires Claude Code's plugin system (agents, skills, slash commands, hooks).

**However**, the `conductor/` directory it creates is just Markdown files. Any AI tool can read them. If you start with SupaConductor and switch tools later, your specs, plans, and documentation remain useful.

### Is this overkill for small tasks?

For a quick one-file fix — yes, just use Claude Code directly. Use SupaConductor when:
- The work touches 3 or more files
- You'd normally plan before coding
- You want automated quality checks
- You want the work done right the first time

You can also use individual commands without the full loop:

```
/orchestrator-supaconductor:board-review Should we use Redis or PostgreSQL for sessions?
/orchestrator-supaconductor:cto-advisor
/orchestrator-supaconductor:writing-plans
```

### Can I use this alongside other Claude Code plugins?

Yes. SupaConductor uses the `/orchestrator-supaconductor:` namespace and doesn't conflict with any other plugins, built-in commands, or MCP servers.

### How do I update to a newer version?

If you installed via marketplace:
```
/install zakhodgsonamauk/orchestrator-supaconductor
```

If you cloned via git:
```bash
cd ~/.claude/plugins/orchestrator-supaconductor && git pull
```

### How do I uninstall?

```bash
# Disable without removing
/plugin    # Toggle it off in the plugin menu

# Full removal
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/orchestrator-supaconductor
```

The `conductor/` directory in your project stays — it's just documentation files.

---

## Migration from the Old Name

If you previously installed `conductor-orchestrator-superpowers` (the old name):

1. Disable the old plugin: run `/plugin` in Claude Code and toggle it off
2. Delete the old folder: `rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers`
3. Install SupaConductor using the [instructions above](#installation)
4. Run `/orchestrator-supaconductor:setup` in your existing projects to update references

Your existing tracks and data are safe — only the command prefix changed from `/conductor:` to `/orchestrator-supaconductor:`.

## Requirements

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) CLI
- Git
- Bash — on Windows this is Git Bash (bundled with Git for Windows); the hooks and the model resolver run under it. No `jq` or other extra tools required.
